# R code and files for creating phylogenetic trees in "Host specificity of Puccinia digitaticoronata, a new crown rust fungus of Kentucky bluegrass in North America"

* Figures were created with ggtree using outputs from mrbayes and MEGA. Hopefully it will be some use to others creating their own phylogenetic trees with the excellent ggtree package.
